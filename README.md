# CloudNativeLab01

## About
The lab is originally created by Rob Porter of Cisco Systems.  This Lab is a copy of the original lab with some improvements.

## Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to introduce some common tools, methodologies and design considerations when you start to build out a Cloud Native application. It will also allow you to become familiar with Docker, interacting with the services and an introduction to the Golang
language.

## Lab requirements
There are only two requirements for this lab;
   1.	A running and installed version of Docker. 
  * Docker for Windows - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/
<br>Be carefull Docker for windows use the Windows 10 Hyper-V feature, if you run VMware Workstation or any other virtualization tool, it's possible the software doesn't work after installing Docker for Windows. After deinstallation everything should be working again.
  * Docker Toolbox - https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/
<br>Installs Docker inside a Oracle VM VirtualBox
  * Docker for Mac - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/
  
   2. An active internet connection to enable you to download some images from Docker Hub
